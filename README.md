### Step 1
1. Create HDF5 files from the input root files which are located here: `$CFS/m3246/ZjetOmnifold/data/slimmed_files/`

| Dataset | Location|
|---------|----------|
| Train MC | WithTracks_ZjetOmnifold_May19_MGPy8FxFxRew_syst_train_Mar1023.root|
| Test MC | WithTracks_ZjetOmnifold_May19_MGPy8FxFxRew_syst_test_Mar0723.root| 
| Pseudodata | WithTracks_ZjetOmnifold_Aug5_PseudoDataSRew_Apr8_1_All.root|
| Truth Pseudodata | WithTracks_TruthPseudodata_Combined_1-18.root|
